TypeDB Cloud is our platform for automatically deploying TypeDB onto the cloud provider of your choice.

To deploy with TypeDB Cloud, you will first need to sign up for an account at https://cloud.typedb.com/sign-up.
Once you have done so, navigate to the Clusters page hit the Deploy button to go to the cluster deployment page.
From that page, you'll be able to configure your cluster, and then deploy it.

Once your cluster is deployed, you will be able to set the password for the default `admin` user.
Make sure to save this password somewhere safe, as you will need it to access your cluster.

Once your password is set, information on connecting to TypeDB Cloud can be found by staying on that page or
