= Upgrading

In this guide, you'll learn how to upgrade to a newer version of TypeDB while preserving your data.

There are two mechanisms in which data can be preserved during a server upgrade:

* If the new version has the same data format as the old one, it should be done by reusing or copying the data directory.
* Otherwise, it should be done by using the export/import tool, which would take care of migrating the data into the new format.

== Preserve data by copying the directory

To do this, simply shut down the servers of the old version, and copy the database to migrate from the data
directory (set with the `--storage.data` command line argument) into the data directory of the new
TypeDB server installation.

Alternatively, just start the new server making sure it uses the same
*data directory* path as the old one.
