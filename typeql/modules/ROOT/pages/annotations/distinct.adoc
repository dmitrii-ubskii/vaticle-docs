= `@distinct` annotation

`@distinct` annotation is used
// tag::overview[]
to restrict an owned list of attributes to distinct values.
// end::overview[]

== Syntax

.Relates syntax
[,typeql]
----
<type label> relates <type label>[] @distinct;
----

.Owns syntax
[,typeql]
----
<type label> owns <type label>[] @distinct;
----

The `@distinct` annotation doesn't accept any arguments, so after the `distinct` keyword always follows either a comma or a semicolon.

== Usage

TypeQL statements with the `@distinct` annotation are used to define a `distinct` constraint for an ordered type capability (i.e., to declare that a list of capabilities is distinct and contains only distinct values).

// TODO: Add reference to lists

[NOTE]
====
Ordered capabilities, lists and their annotations like `@distinct` are not yet introduced in TypeDB. Coming soon!
