:page-aliases: {page-version}@typeql::patterns/conjunction.adoc

A conjunction of patterns requires all its constituent patterns to match its concepts. It is most commonly encountered as the body of a
xref::{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/match.adoc[match clause].

== Syntax

A conjunction is represented by a sequence of patterns, each terminated by a semicolon, enclosed in braces. Like any pattern, the
conjunction is also terminated by a semicolon.

[,typeql]
----
{ <pattern>; <pattern>; [ <pattern>; ... ] };
----

When used as a part of a match clause, the braces and the terminating semicolon can be omitted:

[,typeql]
----
match
  <pattern>; <pattern>; [ <pattern>; ... ]
----

== Example

The following conjunction matches all users with name `Bob Dylan`:

[,typeql,indent=0]
----
include::{page-version}@typeql::example$tql/conjunction.tql[tags=conjunction-example]
----

This is a conjunction of two patterns: it must match some concept `$u` that is an instance of type `user`, _and_ `$u` must have an attribute
of type `name` with value `"Bob Dylan"`.
