= `plays` statement

The statement `<LABEL> plays <SCOPED ROLE LABEL>` is used to identify the `<LABEL>` type as a roleplayer of `<SCOPED ROLE LABEL>`.

== Defining roleplayers

The `plays` keyword can be used to define a type as a roleplayer of a role type.
Note that a scope is required to resolve role type names ambiguity.

[,typeql]
----
define entity user plays parentship:parent;
----

== Matching roleplayers

The `plays` keyword can be used to match all role types a type is playing.

[,typeql]
----
match user plays $r;
----

Or to match all roleplaying types for a <LABEL>.

[,typeql]
----
match $rp plays parent;
----

Note that a scope can be used to have more specific results. The previous query can return results for different role types with the same `<LABEL>`, while the following example returns only relation types with the specified scope.

[,typeql]
----
match $rp plays parentship:parent;
----
