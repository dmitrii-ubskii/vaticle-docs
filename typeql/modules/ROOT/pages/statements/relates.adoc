= `relates` statement

The statement `<RELATION LABEL> relates <LABEL>` is used to identify the `<LABEL>` as a role type related by `<RELATION LABEL>`.

== Defining role types

The `relates` keyword can be used to define a role type for a relation type.

[,typeql]
----
define relation parentship relates parent;
----

== Matching role types

The `relates` keyword can be used to match all role types related by a relation type.

[,typeql]
----
match parentship relates $r;
----

Or to match all relation types for a role type with a label <LABEL>.

[,typeql]
----
match $r relates parent;
----

Note that a scope can be used to have more specific results. The previous query can return results for different role types with the same `<LABEL>`, while the following example returns only relation types with the specified scope.

[,typeql]
----
match $r relates parentship:parent;
----
