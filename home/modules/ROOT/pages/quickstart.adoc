[#_create_free_cluster]
== Create a free cluster

. https://cloud.typedb.com[Create a TypeDB Cloud account]. Your first cluster is free.
. On the *Clusters* dashboard, click *Create cluster*.
. Configure your cluster, then click *Deploy*.

Your cluster will be created in a few seconds and the *Connect to your cluster* dialog will display.


[#_connect_cluster]
== Connect to your cluster

In the *Connect to your cluster* dialog, click *TypeDB Studio*. The dialog will contain instructions to install TypeDB Studio, which can also be found xref:{page-component-version}@home::install-tools.adoc[here].

Once your cluster is online and its sample data has been loaded in, the *Connect to your cluster* dialog will display the
*connection string* for your cluster.

. Copy the connection string and save it in a secure location. You'll need it each time you want to connect to your cluster.
. Open TypeDB Studio. The *Connect to TypeDB* dialog will appear.
. Paste in the copied connection string and click *Connect*. Once this is done, you're ready to begin developing with TypeDB!

[NOTE]

You'll be connected as the default database user, which is created with admin privileges.
