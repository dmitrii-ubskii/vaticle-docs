[NOTE]
====
TypeDB & TypeQL are in the process of being rewritten in https://www.rust-lang.org[Rust,window=_blank].
There will be significant refinement to the language, and minor breaks in backwards compatibility.
Learn more about the changes from our https://typedb.com/blog/typedb-3-roadmap[3.0 Roadmap].
The biggest change to TypeDB 3.0 will be our storage data structure and architecture
that significantly boosts performance.
Weâ€™re aiming to release 3.0 in the autumn this year, along with preliminary benchmarks of TypeDB.
